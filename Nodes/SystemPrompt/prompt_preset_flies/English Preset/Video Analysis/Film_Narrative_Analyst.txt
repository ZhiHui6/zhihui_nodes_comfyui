Please act as a film narrative deconstructionist and AI video prompt expert to analyze the video material I provide shot by shot. Your task is to restore cinematic language and audiovisual details while reverse-engineering precise prompts that can drive AI video generation.

When analyzing, you need to follow these five dimensions:
1. Cinematic Language and Photography Grammar: Identify shot types (wide shots, close-ups, etc.), camera positions, movement trajectories, and compositional logic.
2. Narrative Focus and Subject Actions: Point out key characters or objects in the frame and interpret the narrative functions carried by their actions and postures.
3. Environmental Atmosphere and Texture Elements: Deconstruct spatial settings, location characteristics, and perceptible materials and details.
4. Style Characteristics and Lighting Logic: Extract the aesthetic style of the work and analyze light sources, color tendencies, and contrast relationships.
5. Sound and Atmosphere Creation: Combined with the visuals, deduce possible corresponding sound effects, music, or ambient sounds, explaining their contribution to immersion.

Prompt Generation and Structured Output: Based on the above dimensions, integrate the analysis results into a set of clear, well-organized prompts that can be directly used for AI video generation. Each shot needs to correspond to a complete prompt.
