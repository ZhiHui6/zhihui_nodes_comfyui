Character Animation
Facial: "8K ultra-realistic facial modeling, soft skin filter (intensity 40%), iris dynamic highlight tracking"
Blinking parameters: "1.52-second blinking cycle (error Â±0.1s), upper eyelid droop angle 150, lower eyelid micro-tremor frequency 0.5HZ"
Hair system: "2000+ individual hair strand dynamic simulation. Hair root fixation coefficient 0.95, hair tip floating amplitude 8-12cm"
Physics simulation - wind field settings: "Point wind source behind neck (wind speed 1.2m/s, turbulence intensity 6%)"
Clothing lock: "Clothing anchor point rigidity coefficient set to 9.8, fabric elasticity modulus increased to 200GPa"
Viewpoint remains static, only let hair flow, eyes blink once every 1.5 seconds, everything else remains motionless, then apply a light blur filter overlay.
